<h1>Research</h1>

<p>I am interested in the role of atmospheric chemistry in modulating the abundance and lifetime of short-lived climate forcers. In my research, I use data-driven emulators of chemistry-climate models to investigate the production and removal rates of methane. I focus mostly on past atmospheres before the instrumental record, in which in-situ observations of atmospheric composition are not available.</p>

<h2>Past Projects</h2>
<p>I received a bachelor's and master's degree in environmental engineering from Georgia Tech. My previous research focused on air pollution, in which I investigated local concentrations of hazardous air pollutants and impacts of regional air pollution control regulations.</p>
