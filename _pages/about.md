I am a PhD student at the UW Department of Atmospheric Sciences advised by [Alex Turner](https://alexjturner.github.io/index.html) and [Greg Hakim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-hakim-42945611/). I am interested in the role of atmospheric chemistry in modulating the abundance and lifetime of short-lived climate forcers. In my research, I use data-driven emulators of chemistry-climate models to investigate the production and removal rates of methane. I focus mostly on past atmospheres before the instrumental record, in which in-situ observations of atmospheric composition are not available. 

Beyond research, I enjoy stereotypical Seattleite hobbies such as rock climbing, skiing (poorly), and running.

Past projects
======
I received a bachelor's and master's degree in environmental engineering from Georgia Tech. My previous research focused on air pollution, in which I investigated local concentrations of hazardous air pollutants and impacts of regional air pollution control regulations. 

Air pollution accountability study
------
Air pollution has drastically improved in the Eastern US in the past decades, but it is difficult to attribute air quality improvements to regulations or other events. A report is forthcoming.

Ethylene oxide measurement comparison
------
We worked with the Georgia EPD on this.
