    <h1 class="hero__headline">Hi, I'm Eric Mei.</h1>
    <p class="hero__text">I'm a PhD student in the University of Washington Department of Atmospheric and Climate Science. I use data-driven emulators of chemistry-climate models to understand how chemistry shapes the abundance and lifetime of methane and other short-lived climate forcers, especially in pre-instrumental atmospheres.</p>

    <p>Working with advisors <a href="https://alexjturner.github.io/index.html">Alex Turner</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-hakim-42945611/">Greg Hakim</a>, I study how atmospheric chemistry modulates the climate system. My work uses emulators of chemistry-climate models to trace methane production and removal in the absence of direct observations.</p>

      <h3>Atmospheric chemistry</h3>
      <p>Examining how chemical pathways control the abundance and lifetime of short-lived climate forcers with an emphasis on methane.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Modeling & emulation</h3>
      <p>Building data-driven emulators that make chemistry-climate model insights nimble enough for paleoclimate and scenario testing.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Collaboration</h3>
      <p>Partnering with scientists across UW and beyond to connect atmospheric chemistry, paleoclimate evidence, and climate modeling.</p>

    <span class="eyebrow">Background</span>
    <p>I earned bachelor's and master's degrees in environmental engineering from Georgia Tech, where I studied air pollution—investigating local concentrations of hazardous air pollutants and the effects of regional control regulations. Outside of research you can usually find me climbing, skiing (poorly), or running around Seattle.</p>
