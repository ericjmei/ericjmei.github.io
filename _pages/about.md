I am a PhD student at the [UW Department of Atmospheric and Climate Science](https://atmos.uw.edu/) advised by [Alex Turner](https://alexjturner.github.io/index.html) and [Greg Hakim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-hakim-42945611/). I am interested in the role of atmospheric chemistry in modulating the abundance and lifetime of short-lived climate forcers. In my research, I use data-driven emulators of chemistry-climate models to investigate the production and removal rates of methane. I focus mostly on past atmospheres before the instrumental record, in which in-situ observations of atmospheric composition are not available. 

Beyond research, I enjoy stereotypical Seattleite hobbies such as rock climbing, skiing (poorly), and running.

Past projects
======
I received a bachelor's and master's degree in environmental engineering from Georgia Tech. My previous research focused on air pollution, in which I investigated local concentrations of hazardous air pollutants and impacts of regional air pollution control regulations.
