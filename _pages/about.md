  <h1>Hi, I'm Eric Mei.</h1>
  <p class="lede">PhD student at the University of Washington Department of Atmospheric and Climate Science. I use data-driven emulators of chemistry-climate models to understand how chemistry shapes the abundance and lifetime of methane and other short-lived climate forcers, especially in pre-instrumental atmospheres.</p>
  <p class="lede">Working with <a href="https://alexjturner.github.io/index.html">Alex Turner</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-hakim-42945611/">Greg Hakim</a>, I trace methane production and removal where direct observations are scarce.</p>

  <h2>Current focus</h2>
  <p>Mapping how atmospheric chemistry modulates climate signals, with an emphasis on methane lifetimes and short-lived climate forcers.</p>
  <p>Building emulators of chemistry-climate models that let us test scenarios quickly and connect paleoclimate evidence to mechanistic understanding.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>I earned bachelor's and master's degrees in environmental engineering from Georgia Tech, focusing on air pollution—investigating local concentrations of hazardous air pollutants and the effects of regional control regulations.</p>
  <p>Outside research you can usually find me climbing, skiing (poorly), or running around Seattle.</p>
