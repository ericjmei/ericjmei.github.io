  <h1>What I'm studying</h1>
  <p class="lede">I study how atmospheric chemistry shapes climate signals, with a focus on methane and other short-lived climate forcers. Much of the work looks at times before routine observations, so I rely on data-driven emulators of chemistry-climate models to probe production and removal pathways.</p>

<div class="section block">
  <h2>Methane lifetimes in past climates</h2>
  <p>Tracing how chemistry influenced methane abundance before routine observations and what those dynamics mean for interpreting paleoclimate records.</p>
</div>

<div class="section block">
  <h2>Data-driven emulation</h2>
  <p>Building flexible emulators of chemistry-climate models to test scenarios, quantify uncertainty, and iterate quickly on hypotheses.</p>
</div>

<div class="section block">
  <h2>Air quality foundations</h2>
  <p>Earlier work on hazardous air pollutants and impacts of regional control regulations grounds how I think about atmospheric composition today.</p>
