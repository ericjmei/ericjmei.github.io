    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>I study how atmospheric chemistry shapes climate signals, with a focus on methane and other short-lived climate forcers. Because many of the most interesting questions sit outside the instrumental era, I lean on data-driven emulators of chemistry-climate models to probe production and removal pathways when direct observations are scarce.</p>

      <h3>Methane lifetimes in past climates</h3>
      <p>Tracing how chemistry influenced methane abundance before routine observations and what those dynamics mean for interpreting paleoclimate records.</p>

      <h3>Data-driven emulation</h3>
      <p>Building flexible emulators of chemistry-climate models to test scenarios, quantify uncertainty, and iterate quickly on hypotheses.</p>

      <h3>Air quality foundations</h3>
      <p>Previous work on hazardous air pollutants and the impacts of regional air pollution control regulations continues to ground how I think about atmospheric composition.</p>

    <p>I pair modeling with careful, transparent communication so collaborators can trace assumptions. If you have ideas for joint projects or data that could inform these questions, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
